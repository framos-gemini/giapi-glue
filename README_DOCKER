To use both images the recommended method is to use docker compose to link both GMP and GIAPI glue. 
The docker-compose.yml file can be found here: https://github.com/gemini-hlsw/scorpio-setup

If Compose is used: 

    $ docker-compose up 
This should create the images if are not in local or pull them from the registry (prior configuration).
Both giapi-glue-cc and gmp containers would start, giapi-glue-ext container can be deleted. 

If giapi-glue-cc container does not open in interactive mode:
    
    $ docker run -it --name scorpio_giapi-glue-dev_1 \
            -v $(pwd)/giapi-glue-cc/workspace:/home/software/giapi-glue-cc/workspace \
            --net scorpio_default giapi-glue/build /bin/bash 
This would create a new container (the docker-compose one can be deleted) with a new volume associated.
Check for already created volumes with $ docker volume ls to see if an existing volume may work better or 
just change -v flag value to a volume of your choose. NOTE: This only work if docker-compose is run first.
